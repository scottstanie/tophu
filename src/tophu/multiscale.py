    Apply an anti-aliasing pre-filter, then multilook.

    The input array is filtered by applying a low-pass filter constructed using the
    optimal equiripple method\ :footcite:p:`mcclellan:1973` and then multilooked to
    produce the downsampled output. However, if the number of looks along any axis is 1,
    no filtering will be applied along that axis of the array.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : dask.array.Array
        The input data. A two-dimensional array.
    downsample_factor : tuple of int
        The number of looks to take along each axis of the input array.
    shape_factor : float, optional
        The shape factor of the filter (the ratio of the width of the combined
        pass-band and transition band to the pass-band width). Must be greater than or
        equal to 1. A larger shape factor results in a more gradual filter roll-off.
        (default: 1.5)
    overhang : float, optional
        The fraction of the low-pass filter transition bandwidth that extends beyond the
        Nyquist frequency of the resulting multilooked data. For example, if
        `overhang=0`, the transition band will be entirely within the Nyquist bandwidth.
        If `overhang=0.5`, the transition band will centered on the Nyquist frequency.
        The value must be within the interval [0, 1]. (default: 0.5)
    ripple : float, optional
        The maximum allowed ripple amplitude below unity gain in the pass-band, in
        decibels. (default: 0.01)
    attenuation : float, optional
        The stop-band attenuation (the difference in amplitude between the ideal gain in
